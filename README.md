## Introduction
The project involves the application of two popular clustering algorithms, K-Means and Hierarchical clustering, on 8 different datasets. The aim is to identify patterns and groupings within the datasets. The results of the clustering are visualized using 3D plots for better understanding of the formed clusters.

## Requirements
The project requires the following packages:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Scipy

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Load your dataset using pandas.
2. Preprocess the data if necessary.
3. Apply the K-Means or Hierarchical clustering algorithm on the dataset.
4. Visualize the results using 3D plots.

## Results 

The results section will contain the 3D plots generated from the clustering algorithms. Each plot will represent the clusters formed in each of the 8 datasets. The plots will provide a visual representation of how well the algorithms have performed in identifying clusters within the datasets.
